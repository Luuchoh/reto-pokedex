# Description

It is an application where you can search for your favorite pokemon and add them so you don't forget them.

## Set up

First you must have Node JS installed on your machine.

The technologies I used for this project were ReactJS, React-Redux, React-Bootstrap, Styled-Components, Firebase among many others.

1. After you have installed Node JS on your machine you should clone the repository as follows `git clone (https://github.com/Luuchoh/reto-pokedex)`
2. so you can have it locally but that's not all, you must open a console and position yourself inside it, there you can execute the following command `$ yarn install`. This will download all the necessary dependencies to be able to run the application.
3. After installing the dependencies you will have to create a file called [.env] and inside it write the following: `[REACT_APP_API_URL=](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2)`

## up an running
4. Now this is all we have to install for the project to run locally on your machine so we proceed to type the last command `[$ yarn run start]` inside the console where you installed the dependencies this will open a tab in your default browser and you can see the application.
5. or you can visit `http://localhost:3000`
6. enjoy
